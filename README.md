**Title:** Design, Fabrication, and Testing of Silicon Photonic MZI-Based Polymer Electro-Optic Modulators

**Author:** Timothy Nguyen

**Abstract:** Polymer
electro-optic
(EO)
modulators
were
designed, fabricated, and tested to extract key figures of merit,
namely the half-wave voltage Vπ that is required to shift the
response at the operating wavelength from maximum to
minimum transmission. The devices were designed to minimize
Vπ in layout by employing a push-pull configuration and
minimizing the separation between the metal electrodes used for
poling and modulation. Unique fabrication steps included
patterning using electron-beam lithography, physical vapour
deposition of the metal layer using a custom-built electron-beam evaporator, and poling of the EO material. A successfully-fabricated modulator with modulation length L = 3 mm exhibited Vπ = 6.569 V and VπL = 19.707 Vmm.
